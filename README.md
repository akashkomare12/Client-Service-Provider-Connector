# Django Project with REST APIs
This project is a web application backend built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). It provides a modular and scalable architecture for building RESTful APIs, including user authentication, CRUD operations, and robust database support.

## Project Overview
This project serves as a platform to connect clients with service providers offering various services such as plumbing, electrical work, cooking, and more. The main features include:

- **Client Dashboard**: Clients can book services and view their service history.
- **Service Provider Dashboard**: Service providers can manage incoming service requests.
- **Service Management**: Booked services are reflected on both the client's and service provider's dashboards.
- **Ratings and Feedback**: Clients can rate and review completed services.
- **Status Updates**: Clients can edit the status of services (e.g., completed, canceled, or pending).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- SqLite

## How It Works
1. **API Development**: Uses Django REST Framework to build modular and scalable APIs.
2. **Authentication**: Implements inbuilt authentication for secure user login and session management.
3. **Service Booking**: Clients can book services, which are then reflected in real-time dashboards.
4. **Feedback System**: Clients can provide ratings and feedback on completed services.
5. **Status Management**: Users can update the status of service requests to track progress.
6. **Database Integration**: SqLite for data persistence.


## Future Enhancements
- **Extended Features**: Add advanced filtering and search capabilities.
- **Scalability**: Deploy on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.
- **UI Integration**: Connect the backend to a React or Angular frontend for a complete application.
